Abstract

 A synchrocyclotron .[.comprises.]. .Iadd.includes .Iaddend.a resonant
     circuit that includes electrodes having a gap therebetween across the
     magnetic field. An oscillating voltage input, having a variable amplitude
     and frequency determined by a programmable digital waveform generator
     generates an oscillating electric field across the gap. The
     synchrocyclotron can include a variable capacitor in circuit with the
     electrodes to vary the resonant frequency. The synchrocyclotron can
     further include an injection electrode and an extraction electrode having
     voltages controlled by the programmable digital waveform generator. The
     synchrocyclotron can further include a beam monitor. The synchrocyclotron
     can detect resonant conditions in the resonant circuit by measuring the
     voltage .[.and or.]. .Iadd.and/or .Iaddend.current in the resonant
     circuit, driven by the input voltage, and adjust the capacitance of the
     variable capacitor or the frequency of the input voltage to maintain the
     resonant conditions. The programmable waveform generator can adjust at
     least one of the oscillating voltage input, the voltage on the injection
     electrode and the voltage on the extraction electrode according to beam
     intensity and in response to changes in resonant conditions.

2	Encoding device and decoding device

Abstract

 An encoding device (200) includes an MDCT unit (202) that transforms an
     input signal in a time domain into a frequency spectrum including a lower
     frequency spectrum, a BWE encoding unit (204) that generates extension
     data which specifies a higher frequency spectrum at a higher frequency
     than the lower frequency spectrum, and an encoded data stream generating
     unit (205) that encodes to output the lower frequency spectrum obtained
     by the MDCT unit (202) and the extension data obtained by the BWE
     encoding unit (204). The BWE encoding unit (204) generates as the
     extension data (i) a first parameter which specifies a lower subband
     which is to be copied as the higher frequency spectrum from among a
     plurality of the lower subbands which form the lower frequency spectrum
     obtained by the MDCT unit (202) and (ii) a second parameter which
     specifies a gain of the lower subband after being copied.

3	Integrated chemical looping air separation in large-scale oxy-fuel plants

Abstract

 An integrated chemical looping air separation unit (5) in a large-scale
     oxy-fuel power generating plant takes a portion of recycled flue gas (6)
     via a recycling conduit (7) through a heat exchanger (8) to a reduction
     reactor (9). The reduction reactor (9) exchanges oxidized metal oxide
     with an oxidation reactor (11) via transfer means (10) which return
     reduced metal oxide from the reduction reactor (9) to the oxidation
     reactor (11). This enables the reduction reactor (9) to feed a mixture of
     oxygen and recycled flue gas into the boiler (13) of the power generating
     plant in a more energy efficient manner than conventional oxy-fuel power
     plants using air separation units.

8	Configurable fuse box for modular data center

Abstract

 A power distribution system, modular data center (MDC), and method
     provide a permanent electrical enclosure sized for an eventual maximum
     load allowing for flexible ampacity and concurrent upgradeability. A
     busway is mountable in a MDC to carry three-phase AC electrical power. A
     three-phase electrical cable is rated to carry a maximum power value to
     connect to a power distribution unit (PDU) of a first rack-based
     information handling system (IHS) of the MDC. A bus plug is engaged to
     the first busway and has at least three conduction paths that
     electrically connect to the three-phase electrical cable. Interchangeable
     fused switch modules of different power ratings are selectable to be
     received in a fused switch module receptacle in the bus plug. A reduced
     power fused switch module for initial power capacity of the MDC can later
     be upgraded to a maximum power rating without changing anything but the
     fused switch module.
